## Two Seasons, Two Decades

Everyone thinks my bike looks like a piece of  old crap, but they’ll see. Don’t judge a book   by its cover, you know? That’s what I say. I honestly didn’t think this would become  

a video. I thought I was just taking a break from  work with this fun new travel show in which actor  

Ewan McGregor and his buddy Charley Boorman  go on a motorcycle road trip across Europe. 

There they are, look, there’s our first windmills. It was actually a legacy sequel of sorts,  

because they also did a trip like this, a much  bigger one even, all the way back in 2004,  

which I hadn’t seen yet. You know, we’ve had rain,   we’ve had mud, we’ve had rivers, we’ve had  turned over cars, we’ve had everything. 

And so in between the weekly releases of each  episode of this new season, I checked out their   first adventure as well, and what I discovered  will blow your mind– well, maybe it’s not as  

dramatic as that, but still, there was something  about watching these two journeys that happened  

20 years apart side by side like this that was  quietly profound. And I think it’s because in  

the timing of these two seasons, they sort of  accidentally captured a major transition period  

in our society; one that isn’t just defined by  technological changes, not even just by cultural  

shifts or the rise of social media, but rather  by something deeper, like some kind of spiritual  

reconfiguration in our relation to the world  and in how we move through it, one that seems  

like it’s rapidly eroding so much of what used  to make travelling and just being in the world  

so meaningful. I think that many people who lived  through this transition, myself included, have   already been feeling this somewhat intuitively.  But for me at least, it wasn’t until I sat   down to watch these two guys drive off on their  motorcycles in two completely different historical   eras, that this vague awareness was suddenly  brought into focus, and that I felt like I could   finally see clearly what has been happening, and  on a more hopeful note; what we can do about it.  And I think it’s because in the timing of these  two seasons, they sort of accidentally captured   a major transition period in our society; one  that isn’t just defined by technological changes,   not even just by cultural shifts or the rise of  social media, but rather by something deeper,   like some kind of spiritual reconfiguration  in our relation to the world and in how we   move through it, one that seems like it’s rapidly  eroding so much of what used to make travelling   and just being in the world so meaningful. It’s  something that I’d already been feeling kind of   intuitively and somewhat pessimistically for  a while now, as I’m sure many others have as  

well. And yet, I don’t think I had ever seen  the contrast between then and now as clearly,  

and as insightfully as I did while watching  this show. And more than that, nor had I ever  

encountered a travelogue as surprisingly  uplifting and transformative as this one. 

## The Last Analog Adventure

I don’t know, it was a big heavy bike,  I’ve never really done it before.  First, let’s wind back the clock. The year is  1997. Ewan McGregor stars in a movie where he  

meets Charley Boorman, and soon enough a  lifelong friendship is born. Part of the  

reason why they hit it off so well is because  they both share a passion for motorcycles,  It smells really nice too. and so naturally, the idea  

of going on a trip together became inevitable. We always talked about doing a trip together.  

Maybe to Spain or somewhere like that. But what initially started as a simple  

holiday eventually snowballed into a much  greater ambition: to travel from London all    

the way to New York by going east across the  Eurasian continent, and to document the whole  

adventure with a professional film crew. The idea of filming it in the first place   was to have a record of it, firstly. And long story short, in 2004 this is  

exactly what they did. After weeks of preparation  and training, they set out on their bikes together  

with their cameraman Claudio, who would  be riding with them on his own motorcycle,   and with a small support crew of two  vehicles that followed them from a distance,  

and that they would occasionally link up with  at border crossings and other critical moments. 

A holiday doesn’t have to be lying on a beach,  you know, it can be exploration and an adventure. 

Over the next 3,5 months, they would travel  about 31.000 kilometers, or 19.000 miles,  

across 12 different countries in  Europe, Asia and North America.  Sand and mud today. I feel really,  really far away from home now,  

suddenly much further than I did yesterday. The document of their adventure released later  

that same year, in the fall of 2004,  as the television show Long Way Round. 

For context, just in case 2004 doesn’t feel that  long ago to you, this is when we were still one  

year away from the first ever YouTube video, 2  years away from the first digital GoPro camera,  

and 3 years away from the first iPhone. In this  sense, Long Way Round might just be one of the  

last documented analog adventures, one of the  last portraits of a world that was right on the  

precipice of changing forever. See you in New York! 

Actually, I should mention, they did make  another season soon after the first one,   which I would consider as still  existing in that same historical space. 

When we first met up in London after we’d  hadn’t seen each other for a little while,   we started talking about Africa. Long Way Down, as it was called, took place  

in 2007, which was still about a month before  the first iPhone came out, and 3 years before  

people would first begin posting travel pics on  Instagram. In this season, Ewan and Charley rode  

from Scotland down into the African continent,  all the way to Cape Town in South Africa. 

Our first African camp, Charley! And so technically speaking,   we have two documents of what I guess can be  called the before time. And to see clearly what  

exactly has changed since, what exactly defines  the transition period that followed soon after,  

this is where we jump to the next time that Ewan  and Charley got back together on the road again,   which wouldn’t be until our current decade. I’m dying to get out there.  

I want to be on a trip again. Here again, we technically have two   new seasons. First, there’s Long Way Up from 2020,  in which they traveled from the Southern tip of  

Argentina up to Los Angeles in the United States. And we’ve got just 3 months to   do it. There’s a lot to do. And then there’s Long Way Home,  

the new 2025 release where they  make a round trip across Europe.  It’s funny, isn’t it? 20 years this year  of doing this, that’s bizarre, isn’t it? 

## The Democratization of Imagery

So to get the obvious evolution out of the way,  let’s briefly talk about the visual presentation. 

We’ve got a shot of you riding the bike, shot  looking forward, and a shot from your lid.  It’s kind of funny how you wouldn’t include this  now, and in fact, the new seasons don’t even  

really bother to, but in the first two journeys,  they spend a whole episode on the preparation in   which they cover, among other things, the  process of actually documenting the trip. 

We want to film this but we don’t want to be  surrounded by loads of cameramen so we’re just  

trying to figure out the best way to do it. They talk about using state of the art helmet  

cameras, they explain the need for these cases  upon cases of additional filming equipment,  

and just reflect on the general challenges  of documenting an adventure of this size. 

We’re taking so much camera equipment on this  trip that we decided to take two camera vehicles. 

Can you see me now? Today, interestingly enough,   it’s not so much that the visual language has  actually changed all that much. I mean, sure the  

image quality got a lot better and they added a  drone to their repertoire, which they didn’t have   before. But other than that, the show looks pretty  much the same. It’s still a mix of second unit  

establishing shots, footage filmed by cameraman  Claudio, footage filmed with Ewan and Charley’s  

helmet cameras, and moments taken from the video  diaries which Ewan and Charley kept along the way. 

Have you been keeping a diary? No, have you? No. The real difference then is more about the way  

this visual language has become so commonplace  now, how it has become democratized. 

They must have made a James Bond movie  here, surely. We’ve got a tunnel, and  

James Bond, and all of this, look. Now of course, all that pro-gear   of yesteryear exists as typical consumer  products; action cameras, pocket cameras,  

phone cameras, cinema cameras, camera drones,  all of these have become the standard toolkit  

not just of professional travel shows, but also of  individual creators, of solo travelers, Instagram  

influencers, hobby cinematographers, and just  everyday folks making personal holiday videos;  

a group that I would also include myself in. I’ve  been fortunate enough to have taken some bigger  

trips, including an amazing honeymoon to New  Zealand, which had been on my bucket list ever   since I first saw the Lord of the Rings as a 10  year old. And even though these videos are just  

part of my private memories, I still liked the  idea of also creating something that could may as  

well have been a real travel show, and although  I’m by no means an expert cinematographer,   I do think I got some pretty good-looking  footage here and there. But anyways, the  

point is that nowadays, the technology itself is  no longer really an obstacle. Pretty much anyone,  

anywhere can now go out and capture what they  encounter in clear images and great detail,  

and more importantly; they can now share  it online for the whole world to see.  

And this brings us to what might just be the  real defining feature of this transition period,   which contrary to what you might be thinking  right now, is not so much about the rise of  

the internet and of social media perse, but more  so about its second order effect, which is that  

in this overwhelming flood of images, videos  and documents, in this rapid digital charting  

of the world around us, it feels like we have  accidentally killed the meaning of an adventure. 

## A True Measure of Distance

I felt like some great explorer. We were  really riding our bikes into nowhere. 

While watching the first two seasons, there was  one thing in particular that really struck me,   which was the palpable feeling of  distance in every meaning of the word. 

Now look, there’s absolutely nothing  that way. Absolutely nothing that way.  The roads were long, the terrain a continuous  challenge, and traversing it felt impactful,  

it felt risky even, in a way one would expect  when venturing so deep into the unknown. 

So sticky and so slippy. You  okay? Look at this place! 

I remember especially this part where they  were travelling down the Road of Bones in far   east Russia; a long, Soviet Era highway  that has largely fallen into disrepair. 

There’s been a mounting sense  of fear about the whole thing.  Despite having received warnings from the locals,  they went ahead anyways and soon encountered  

broken down bridges and whole sections of  the road that were reclaimed by rivers. 

The roads just deteriorated and deteriorated,  it was just everything thrown at us at  

once. We could never ride across that,  it’s far too deep, current’s too strong. 

They were lucky to encounter some big rig  trucks, which were the only vehicles to   occasionally traverse this ghost highway, and  in hindsight clearly the only ones capable of  

doing so. But even then, pulling the support  vehicles through the rapid currents was a  

seriously nerve-wrecking ordeal, with a tensity  that rivaled even the most thrilling Hollywood  

productions. And it wasn’t just because of the  immediate dangers; the risk of getting stuck,  

of losing their equipment and so on, but also  because you knew that all this was taking  

place at the absolute pinnacle of their sort of  psychological or sociological distance as well. 

That’s no good, that’s no good, that's no good! At this point in the journey, they were hundreds   of kilometers into what is essentially no man’s  land, thousands of kilometers removed from home.  

They were in a place they had barely ever seen  images of. Had no idea what the landscape ahead  

would look like. What they did know was that  there was no AAA service here, no one to call,  

no Reddit forums to ask questions in. The people  they did encounter were few, and none spoke their  

language. Again, in every sense of the word, they  were truly distanced from the world they knew. 

We got to a point where we couldn’t ride  any further. This bit has beat us actually. 

Now obviously they were never going to  re-create this particular kind of excitement   driving around Europe in 2025, but even in  the 2020 season, when they crossed the whole  

## Domesticating the World

of the South American continent, that impact of  distance also felt strangely different. And this  

wasn’t because they didn’t venture into faraway  difficult-to-traverse places, because they did.  These roads might be a little bit… You  okay? You alright? I’m good, I’m fine. 

No, it was because of a change in that other form  of distance, let’s call it symbolic distance,  

that one that is only experienced when you’re  far removed from the world you know in those   more psychological, social and linguistic terms,  when you’ve truly ventured into what to you is  

uncharted land, into those faraway places of  which you have little preconceived notions,  

few clear images, and limited tools by which  to traverse them. Because nowadays, that just  

doesn’t really happen anymore, does it? There’s a  small moment in the South America trip where Ewan,  

thousands of kilometers away from home, casually  records a foreign language with his phone which  

feeds it right back to him in plain English. And  it just feels so indicative of how our interaction  

with the world, at least in relation to travel,  has become so different now. Language barriers are  

easily overcome with translation apps. Every phone  is also a GPS that lets us navigate even the most  

remote places with relative ease. Social media  and Google reviews guide us in where to go and  

what to do. And all the while, we remain tethered  to the place we left, to our everyday concerns,  

connections and distractions. It’s like  the world’s distant frontiers have been  

digitally domesticated, its once adventurous  essence now made convenient and familiar. 

## The Rise of Modern Travel Culture

It is a fundamental transformation  not just of how we travel, but also   of what it means to travel in the first  place. Because perhaps most importantly,  

what all this has resulted in is that we  transitioned from a world of imagination  

to one that feels like it’s been entirely  encapsulated within our symbolic field,  

one in which the once blank spaces of curiosity  have been completely inundated with images. 

Machu Pichu day. And there it  is, I gotta turn the camera. 

Seeing Ewan and Charley visit the great  lost city of the Incas for example,   feels entirely different now because you’ve  probably already seen the exact same pictures  

of it a thousand times already on Instagram  reels, YouTube videos and friends’ photos.  

Your symbolic distance from the place has already  been significantly diminished. And while you would  

think this would make the act of travelling  somewhat redundant, clearly, it has actually  

had the opposite effect, it actually created  a new and much more expansive travel culture,  

one that also signifies a more fundamental shift  in how we interact with the world. It’s a culture  

that is no longer really defined by discovery,  or by adventure, but rather by consumption. 

Oh goodness, this wasn’t quite the experience  I was expecting to have up here, ah well.  Today, it feels like we no longer travel into the  unknown as much as we are trying to actualize a  

pre-existing mental image of it. Or to put it like  this: the foreign is no longer just a fascination,    

it has also become a commodity, it has become  a product to be selected and purchased,  

one that we might even feel socially pressured to  consume as part of our personal identity projects,  

you know, as a form of social capital. After  all, in an increasingly individualized world,  

we desire unique experiences so that we can stand  out as unique individuals. And we better get them  

fast, for the supply, it seems, is limited. We all know that the classical tourist  

## Chasing "Authenticity"

destinations have long since been overrun, you  don’t want to be found at the Trevi fountain or   in Santorini no more. No, the name of the game  is ‘authenticity’ now; it’s about seeking out  

the hidden gems, the undiscovered secrets and  all the “come here now while it is still pure”  

type of places. In this sense, it kind of feels  like what we’re really after is exactly that  

lost sense of adventure, to find some place that  hasn’t yet been enveloped by the world we left,  

find some image that hasn’t yet been rendered  profane. But of course, the ironic tragedy here  

is that with each secret we uncover, each place we  visit while it is still pure, we contribute to its  

loss of that special status. And indeed, more  often than not, the “authenticity” we believe  

to have found turns out to have already been  folded into the mold anyways. That rundown barn  

in the Alps where your grandfather once slept  in exchange for a good conversation is now an  

expensive Airbnb experience, a rare find, though!  Key’s in the lockbox. Your local guide in Vietnam  

is on Instagram and locked into the same Twitter  discourse as you are. And no matter where you go,  

it feels like it’s always the same candy bar  wrappers and half-empty fast food bags that are   littering the landscape. All of this, of course,  is part of a much wider process of globalization,  

of the more general homogenization of culture  that has been going on since long before Ewan  

and Charley set out on their first adventure.  And yet, I can’t help but feel like these last  

2 decades or so have nevertheless formed  a significant escalation of whatever was  

already going on before. It’s like we all  have this subconscious feeling that we’re   running out of something important, and it’s  put us in this desperate frenzy to grab what  

little we can before nothing is left. Ok let’s do it. Alright here we go,  

## A Surprising Change of Heart

another day. I feel like my bike is  so noisy, wish it was a bit quieter. 

With all this in mind, I was initially  watching Ewan and Charley’s latest season   with some cynicism, watching it as a leisurely  trip that, while still being fun enough,  

was ultimately little more than an impression of  the true adventures they had 20 years earlier. 

Poppies! Wow, beautiful poppy fields, holy moly. To add to the nostalgia, they even chose to ride  

vintage motorcycles this season. As if they  figured that if the road itself wasn’t going   to give them any troubles, they might as well  create some drama by hopping on bikes that were  

sure to break down at some point. Give it a wiggle mate give it   a wiggle. Your fingers okay? Yep. But as I got deeper into the season, that initial  

feeling actually started to change. Instead of  finding merely a lamentation for what was lost,  

surprisingly enough, I also ended up finding  an inspiration for what can still be regained. 

Ah man, the idea of riding the  bike to your house, so exciting.  For while the journey itself was  far less ambitious this time around,  

just exploring their own backyard, as they  put it, they did still bring with them that   same adventurous spirit that also propelled  them across the world all those years ago. 

It is such a beautiful part of  the world, Austria, I love it.  And especially in today’s consumerist travel  culture, that actually felt kind of revelatory.  

Because as they were making their way through  Europe, and traversing its many backroads, small  

towns and local traditions, what they demonstrated  was not just the idea that there’s always more to  

discover even in the places that you consider  close to home and already familiar. But more  

importantly, it was a reminder that travelling  is not really an act of geographical movement,  

or an experience to consume. Rather, it’s  a mode of being, it’s an attitude. It’s a  

purposeful relinquishing of the everyday to open  yourself up to the unknown and the unfamiliar.  

It’s the feeling of looking at the horizon and  wondering what’s beyond. It’s to follow nothing  

other than your own curiosity, to temporarily  disconnect yourself, run wild, and be free. 

You have to be open to the journey.  Look at this. Very pretty, beautiful. 

## Reclaiming the Adventure

Look, we all know the saying “it’s the journey,  not the destination,” and yet, despite being a  

tired cliche, it still feels like we’ve forgotten  the truth which it represents. We’re flying more  

often and further away than we ever did in the  past, we follow where the clout has already been,  

chasing these supposedly “authentic” experiences  that in reality have already been pre-curated.  

We are essentially skipping the journey for the  destination. Part of what made those original  

seasons so adventurous was exactly because of how  distance, both in physical and symbolical terms,  

accumulated slowly between the travelers and  their home, with every new destination becoming  

more impactful precisely because you could feel  the growing weight of journey that preceded it. 

We’ve come this far and people’s faces  have changed and people’s houses have  

changed and people’s beliefs may have changed. And while it’s not pushed to the extreme lengths  

as it was in the past, it is still there  in the new season too. It still shows how  

there’s a wholly different experience that  opens up when you’re not just taking that   cheap 90 minute flight to your destination, but  instead dedicate yourself to feeling every inch  

of ground that leads towards it, to witness  all the in-between spaces that you would have   skipped over otherwise, and in that process, to  imprint on your psyche a real measure of distance. 

This is also why Ewan and Charley drive on  motorcycles, it’s because, as they repeat  

throughout each adventure, it allows them  to feel the earth vibrating beneath them,  

the air flowing around them. It’s because  it makes them feel connected to the world   they’re travelling through, which in turn renders  their experience more immediate and impactful. 

It becomes another sensual experience as you  ride along. You said something yesterday when  

you said it’s sort of humbling and I think  it’s true, it sort of puts you in touch with   yourself and the world in a way, and you realize  it’s the beauty of it, and the vastness of it. 

And that’s something you just don’t get when you  step out that airplane all hazy and disoriented.  

In fact, from this perspective, the notion of jet  lag is not just your body adjusting to a rapid  

shift in time zones, it’s a moral punishment  for having cheated distance. Now of course,  

I’m being a little dramatic here. Obviously,  if it’s it been your lifelong dream to travel   somewhere far that is only doable by airplane,  then by all means go for it. I did, more than  

once even. But still, I did feel it was important  to talk about this, because all this stuff, it’s  

not just about travelling itself, it’s not about  where you’re going, or about how you get there.  

No rather, it’s about our longing to experience  something that we so easily forget, that so  

easily slips away in our day to day existence. It just became really apparent that this journey  

## The Real Wake-Up Call

should be shared with, you know, with him. The actual reason why there was such a long  

gap in between the first and later seasons  is because for both Ewan and Charley,  

life simply got in the way. Ewan had his career  in Los Angeles, Charley had his in England,  

and the two just lost touch for a while. That  is, until Charley got into a serious motorcycle  

accident that he was very lucky to survive. How is Charley, Olly? I woke up in intensive  

care and had a massive brain injury. I got a  text saying he’d had a horrendous motorcycle  

accident. And I broke my pelvis, the ribs were  smashed, collarbone was broken. Other people  

wanna run again or do whatever but I want to get  myself better enough to get back on a motorbike. 

In the aftermath, the two men reconnected  again, as if being suddenly reminded   of what truly mattered to them. I was reaching out to him more,  

and keeping in touch about his rehab. And soon enough,   they were back on their bikes again. Here we are, Long Way Four, Long Way Four! 

Now, Charley had recovered as well as he  could, but physically, he hasn’t been the same,  

which is part of why the newer seasons don’t  feel quite as dangerous as the older ones.  I’ll get my scooter. But then again,  

it was actually kind of endearing to see Ewan  being so concerned about his friend’s safety. 

Are you okay? Have you hurt yourself?  It’s fine I think I’m okay. I can breathe. 

Also, we should take into account here that  since their first adventure, both men have  

aged with more than 20 years by now. We’ve all got older. You don’t look   a day older. Thank you, don’t feel it. In this sense, the transition period that feels so  

poignant in between their first and last adventure  isn’t just defined by a societal shift, but also  

by a much more personal one; the transition from  a life that’s staring wide-eyed into the future,  

to one that’s already begun to look back, that’s  really starting to feel the weight of time. 

I’m sure it’s gonna be an emotional  moment. A day of memories today, really. 

## 20 Years From Now

At one point during their 2025 trip across  Europe, they pass the same road that they  

also traveled on during the first season all  the way back in 2004, and visit the same place  

where they also stood as younger men. 20 years ago we looked down this hole   Charley and here we are again. None the wiser.  This is gonna be the cruel cut back and forth  

between us 20 years ago and now. Oh, I  dropped it. That’s very good luck that. 

And I found this to be a surprisingly moving  moment. Because as they were reminiscing about  

their past experiences from when they were still  in their early 30s, roughly the same age that I  

am right now, I just couldn’t help but imagine  myself in their place, couldn’t help but wonder  

what stories I’ll be recounting 2 decades from  now, what present experiences will stay with me  

in the years to come, and what friendships  will define me for the rest of my days. 

I’m so glad, 20 years, that we’re still  knocking around through the world on bikes.

It made me realize that in between these  contrasting seasons, in between the analog  

era and the digital age, the daring expedition  and the leisurely trip, what I saw above all else,  

and what probably got me hooked on this show to  begin with, was the way it captured a deep and  

genuine yearning for life, a longing to have those  meaningful experiences, to make those connections,  

and to just be amazed and surprised and  nurtured by the world and the people around us. 

There’s something very attractive about  being on the road, you know, you yearn  

for adventure and not knowing what comes ahead. In this sense, an adventure is even more than   a mode of being, more than a momentary escape  from the everyday. It’s a creator of stories,  

a forger of bonds. Or, to repurpose another  cliché, it’s the friends we made along the way. 

Being on the road with Charley is something  that I share with him and no one else,   you know, he’s in my mirror or I’m in  his. It's so familiar. We've done so  

many thousands of miles like that, you know. I think as you get older you're much more   precious with the people that you spend time  with. And Ewan is one of those people. I wasn't  

really going anywhere until we did Long Way  Round, so I feel very grateful that I met Ewan. 

It's been amazing. It has. Thank you,  Ewan. It's been great fun. Thank you, man. 

## Making a Difference

By now, it's been a few months since I’ve watched  the show, and already I’ve felt a significant   shift in my own desire for travelling and  exploration, felt a desire to slow things down,  

to focus less on chasing manufactured consumerist  desires, and more on just being out there with the  

people I care about. But then again, more than  merely changing our own attitude and finding   refuge in our own little bubble of experience,  I think it’s also important to acknowledge that  

the world is changing around us, that there is  a real vulnerability to exactly those pristine  

places we love to journey into, and that we  ourselves therefore play a significant role  

in deciding their fate one way or another. This is  something that Ewan and Charley also make a point  

of as in each season, they make an active effort  to contribute to some greater good beyond their  

own adventure, and to leave each place a little  better than they found it. And in that spirit, I  

wanted to do the same, I wanted to make this video  not just to generate personal insight, but also  

to inspire actual material change, which is why  I was so happy to once again be able to partner  

up with the amazing community-funded organization  that is protecting biodiversity around the globe:  

the nature protection organization Planet Wild. Through a global community of nature enthusiasts    

who care deeply about the natural world, Planet  Wild is engaged in a wide variety of conservation  

projects. Every month their community funds a  new project partner to protect animals, forests  

and oceans and each project is documented and can  be viewed on their YouTube channel, which is not  

just a great way to see what your contribution  helped achieve, but which is also genuinely   inspiring as it demonstrates how simple local  initiatives can actually make a huge difference,  

such as this project where they are helping to  protect one of Europe’s last ancient forests,  

which is one that is especially close to my heart  as I’d love to explore more of my own continent,   and have actually been planning a road  trip across the Balkan countries where  

much of that last remaining wilderness is located. Planet Wild is basically crowdfunding for nature,  

which I think is a great way to help from a  distance. If you like to support their efforts,   you can become a member right now through a  monthly contribution of your own choosing – big  

or small, whatever feels right. You can  start for as little as the price of a coffee,   and you can cancel anytime. If you join  through my personal link, this QR code,  

or by using the code STORIES210, then I’ll  make sure that the first 100 people to sign  

up will get their first month paid for by me.  You’ll immediately start making a difference,  

for ourselves and for the future and you’ll  become part of a global conservative community  

dedicated to preserving nature and maintaining  the world’s sacred wilderness. If you want to  

see Planet Wild in action, watch their video  protecting Europe’s ancient forests here.
