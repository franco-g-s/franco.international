Life is good.
Our entire lives, we've been taught that
we needed to be exceptional, that
average was something we needed to
escape, that if we didn't do something
remarkable with our lives, we failed.
But no one ever stopped to define what
average actually meant. A stable job, a
partner, a house, two kids. Because if
that's average, why were we ever taught
to fear it? The truth is, none of those
things were ever the problem. Everything
you've been told about being average has
been a lie. Average was never about the
life you live. It was always about
something much deeper than that.
[Music]
So, what have you learned from our
chops? What do you take away from?
Uh, be open to experience. Be willing to
try new things. Don't be afraid to
wander. Don't be afraid to eat a bad
meal. You know, if you don't risk the
bad meal, you'll never get the magical
one.
Anthony Bourdain knew what an average
life really was and why we're so afraid
of it before becoming a famous author
and TV show personality. Bourdain spent
two decades working in professional
kitchens. He graduated in 1978 from the
Culinary Institute of America. And in
his early career, Bourdain worked as a
line cook and sue chef at restaurants
across New York. And all the while he
carried a different dream to be a
writer. He wrote his first book bone and
throat which received lackluster reviews
and his second book Gone Bamboo also
shared the same fate. Both books sold
poorly and his writing career became
stagnant. You see, Bourdain was 42. He
was beginning to accept that the dream
he once had wasn't for him. So, he
turned his focus back to cooking. He
worked his way up to executive chef at
Brazil Leal, a respected French
restaurant in Manhattan. From an outside
perspective, Bourdain made it. He had a
great job, stability, and all the money
he needed to live a comfortable life, a
life many people would be grateful for.
So, why not just stop there? Why not
lean into the life he fought so hard to
build? And that's exactly what most
people do. As time passes, they get set
in their ways. They convince themselves
that the life they built is enough. They
find a job that pays the bills. It's not
perfect, but it's fine. A partner they
love deeply, someone to come home to.
They move into a place that feels just
big enough. Buy furniture they'll keep
for years, and fall into routines that
make life easier. Nothing is wrong. And
that's the danger.
[Music]
This is where most people misunderstand
what an average life actually is.
Because you can wake up every morning,
go to work, come home, build a family,
live quietly, and still live a deeply
fulfilled life. Millions of people dream
of exactly that. But it feels like this
generation is convinced that stability
isn't enough. Social media brainwashed
us into believing that we should chase
unrealistic perceptions of money and
materialism and that if we didn't have
this checklist of things done before a
certain age, you're falling behind. But
an extraordinary life isn't defined by
starting a 100 million business or
becoming an athlete or a celebrity.
Because average was never about
structure. It was never about a 9 to5 or
a house or a routine. It was always
about your mentality. A stable life
isn't the problem. The problem is never
challenging yourself within it. Because
somewhere along the way, comfort quietly
replaces courage. You stop trying new
things, stop doing things you're bad at.
You only ever choose the options you
know will work out. And over time, you
begin to resent the very life you once
prayed for. And slowly, days start to
feel the same. They turn into weeks and
weeks into years. And one day you wake
up and realize something terrifying. You
never took a single real risk. Never
once stepped outside the routine. Never
once asked more of yourself. That's what
being average actually is.
[Music]
Anthony Bourdain knew this. He knew that
coasting through life doesn't end in
failure. It ends in something far more
dangerous. A life where you're satisfied
but not fulfilled. And Bourdain knew
that if he stayed there long enough, he
wouldn't just lose the dream. He'd lose
the courage to ever try again. The only
way forward was to take the risk. But
before he could do that, he had to
confront the one thing that stops people
from ever doing so.
Your ego.
Ego follows you everywhere. It shapes
your decisions. quietly disguising
itself as excuses like, "I'm being
realistic." And humans are inherently
egotistical. We want things to go our
way. We want to avoid looking foolish or
unprepared. And that's why most people
never try anything new. They don't pick
up the hobby, never speak up at work or
talk to the stranger across the street
because a rejection or failure feels
humiliating.
It's easier to protect the image you
have of yourself than to risk watching
it break. I didn't have time. something
came up or maybe later. Those excuses
feel safer than saying I tried and I
wasn't good enough. So most people
choose the first. They protect their
identity in the present even when it
cost them their future. And the tragedy
is that ego doesn't stop you from
failing. It stops you from ever finding
out who you could have been.
And this is where Bourdain did something
most people never do. You see, he had
already failed twice. He had every
reason to stop trying. He could have
came up with a million excuses, but he
realized he had grown to become the very
type of person he once resented. So, he
picked up the pen again. He wrote an
essay called Don't Eat before reading
this. Although it was only ever meant to
be for the line cooks that he worked
with, he did attempt to publish his
work. His mom was the one who helped
them submit it to The New Yorker, one of
the biggest magazine companies at the
time, a place you don't submit to unless
you're certain you belong. Bourdain
wasn't certain, but certainty was the
one thing he had already decided to
reject.
So, he sent it and after just a few
days,
he got a call.
In classic storytelling, there's a
moment in every protagonist journey
where they must overcome something
called the ego death. Often temporary
loss of one's sense of self or personal
identity. This is usually in the form of
some sort of humiliation, sacrifice or
failure. Regardless, they must overcome
this ego death to reach resolution. And
we are the protagonists of our own
lives. To reach fulfillment, we have to
go through this. You have to lose your
ego. The version of yourself that needs
certainty, that needs to look competent.
That's the price of a meaningful life. A
small death of your identity. Bourdain
didn't know if the call would change his
life. He only knew that staying safe
would quietly erase it. And as soon as
Bourdain did this, well, the rest is
history.
Expanding on his article, he went on to
write Kitchen Confidential, an
unflinching look at the food service
industry that became a number one New
York Times bestseller. The book success
propelled him onto television, becoming
the host of No Reservations and Parts
Unknown, on which he traveled the world
sampling different foods and engaging
with different cultures. Everything he
became traced back to one decision,
choosing uncertainty
over safety. And Bourdain spread his
philosophy to millions, hoping to
inspire at least one person to do the
same, to embrace the unknown, to try and
fail, to be wrong. Bourdain never
stopped living like this. He was always
chasing new experiences, new cultures,
finding new ways to escape comfort. One
of his quotes that always stuck with me
was, "Go somewhere you've never been. It
doesn't always have to be about travel,
but maybe something as simple as taking
a new route to work one day or trying a
new coffee shop. Anything that brings
you out of your comfort zone because ego
is what creates the comfort zone and the
comfort zone is where dreams go to die.
So instead of risking discomfort now,
ego offers you a trade. Stay comfortable
today and we'll deal with the
consequences later. And those
consequences don't show up immediately.
They show up years later. It arrives as
a sentence you hear one day and can't
unhear. If only I tried.
It's regret. Because what if Bourdain
had never sent that article? What if he
had given up after his first two books
flopped? He would end up with the same
fate millions of people settle for, an
average life.
one filled with regret.
[Music]
And the only way to live a life without
regret is to escape the comfort zone.
But here's where most people mess up.
They think escaping the comfort zone
means blowing up their life. It's not.
It doesn't mean quitting your job to
start a business or leaving everything
behind and moving across the world.
That's not what Bourdain did either.
When he sent that essay to the New
Yorker, he kept his job. Even when they
offered him a contract to write his
book, his risk was small. Picked up
writing again. Even when he was
comfortable being a chef, submitting an
essay to a place he wasn't sure he
belonged. Those aren't dramatic leaps.
They're what I call small ego deaths.
And this is how you truly create an
extraordinary life. Bourdain once said,
"I am eager to believe that I'm
completely wrong about everything." And
that one sentence perfectly explains his
entire life because if you're wrong,
you're willing to embarrass yourself.
You're willing to try. You're willing to
embrace discomfort. So try something
new. Pick up a new skill. Talk to a
stranger. Try a new restaurant. Share
your work before it's perfect. Go
somewhere unfamiliar without a plan. And
this is how you need to live every day
in the present because this moment is
all we have. As humans, we tend to focus
so much on the future. In a way, it's a
paradox because we fear an average life
so much, but only in hindsight because
we fear discomfort in the present more.
So, it was never about a 9 to5 or a
routine or even comfort. Those were not
the enemies. It was always about letting
those things control you.
