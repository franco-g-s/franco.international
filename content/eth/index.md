# ETH Zürich Academic Notes

This section contains my notes from courses at ETH Zürich's Mechanical Engineering program.

## About These Notes

These are post-processed, atomic notes organized by topic and course. They represent my understanding and interpretation of the material covered in lectures, readings, and coursework.

The notes focus on making complex concepts accessible and interconnected, using wikilinks to show relationships between ideas across different courses.
