### My Training Philosophy
IMO, the best workout plan is the one you can keep. Since everybody's situation and goals are different, there can't possibly be one single ideal training plan. For me in my current situation with my current goals, that means a flexible plan that can adapt to the amount of free time I can invest and also how I'm feeling energy-wise. Therefore my training plan is more of a rough guide as to what a week should look like. 
In an ideal world I would run 3x a week, go to the gym 3x a week, and cycle 3x a week, sprinkle in a couple swimming sessions, go hiking and skiing on the weekends, have 2 break days a week, and still have time for mobility and flexibility training. Sadly a week doesn't have 18 days. 

### My Training Goals for 2026
