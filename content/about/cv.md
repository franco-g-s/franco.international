## About Me

A high school graduate with a broad international background, currently in a gap year focused on hands-on learning, cultural exchange, and community service. Born in Mexico and raised across China, Panama, and Switzerland, I've explored design and engineering through various independent and structured projects. Academically, I've concentrated on subjects such as biology, mathematics, and geography. My multilingual background has developed both in and outside of the classroom, and I enjoy projects that combine design, emerging technologies, and collaborative problem-solving. I'm an enthusiast endurance athlete who loves being outdoors, including cycling, swimming, running, rowing, hiking and skiing.
