# About Me

Hi! I'm Franco Gómez Schumacher, a high school graduate currently in a gap year focused on hands-on learning, cultural exchange, and community service.

Born in Mexico and raised across China, Panama, and Switzerland, I've grown up navigating multicultural environments across four continents. I'm passionate about design, engineering, and projects that combine emerging technologies with collaborative problem-solving.

I'm also an enthusiast endurance athlete who loves being outdoors—whether cycling, swimming, running, rowing, hiking, or skiing.

## What I'm Doing

Currently in my gap year (2025-2026), I'm:
- Working in a **robotics research lab at ETH Zürich** (January–February 2026) as part of my Swiss social service
- Completed a **life sciences internship at Accelerated Bio in Taiwan** (September–November 2025) while recovering my Mandarin
- Starting my **Mechanical Engineering Bachelor at ETH Zürich** in Fall 2026

I enjoy working on technical projects that blend design, hardware, and software—from custom ergonomic keyboards to biomechanical measurement systems for rowing.

## This Digital Garden

This website serves as my public knowledge base, where I share notes, projects, and reflections. It's built using Quartz and published from my personal Obsidian vault.

The content here represents a curated selection of my notes - things I've learned, projects I'm working on, and ideas I'm exploring.
