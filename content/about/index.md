## This Digital Garden

This website serves as my public knowledge base, where I share notes, projects, and reflections. It's built using Quartz and published from my personal Obsidian vault.

The content here represents a curated selection of my notes - things I've learned, projects I'm working on, and ideas I'm exploring.
