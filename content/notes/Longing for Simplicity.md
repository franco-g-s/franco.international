Simplicity in the modern age is often something that people strive for. This longing is very new and stems from the fact that people want what they can’t have. In the past, people always wanted more money, status, complexity or detail, which were all hard to get or achieve. Simplicity is increasingly hard to attain, which is why people want it more every time.
