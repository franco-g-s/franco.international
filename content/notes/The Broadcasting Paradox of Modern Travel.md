In the modern age of travel, we feel compelled to share everything. We broadcast our journeys as they unfold, keeping everyone constantly informed about where we are and what we're doing. When I compare this to the old stories - people going on adventures to unknown lands and returning with enough stories to last a lifetime - the modern way seems empty.

I saw a reel once where someone talked about how he explicitly didn't post anything for an entire year of traveling. Didn't share what he was up to or where he was in any detail. Then one day he just showed up back home with nothing but a million stories. That resonated deeply with me.

There's something lost when you *perform* travel in real-time rather than *experience* it. The Instagram story at a viewpoint pulls you out of the moment - you're thinking about angles, captions, how it will be received. You're mediating the experience instead of having it. You're collecting stories to broadcast, not to truly live.

But there's a tension here that I wrestle with. Complete disconnection isn't really an option for me. I value staying in contact with friends and family. I have more friends abroad than at home, so seeing what they're up to via social media is genuinely valuable. I also like my family knowing where I am and that I'm safe. So zero sharing isn't the answer.

The question becomes: how do you stay connected without performing?

**The delayed sharing paradox**: You might think posting after the trip solves this. But I've noticed that it doesn't necessarily fix the problem - it just changes it. Instead of worrying about posting in the moment, you're constantly thinking about capturing content for future posts. You're still not fully present; you're just procrastinating the performance.

This extends beyond social media to documentation itself. I catch myself thinking about capturing the shot - not necessarily for posting, but just for future reference, to prove I saw it, to remember easier. But in doing so, I'm not actually *seeing* it. The camera becomes insurance against forgetting, but the act of documenting can actually prevent genuine memory formation.

This relates to that scene in [[media/movies/The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013)]] where Sean O'Connell, the photographer, chooses not to photograph the snow leopard. Sometimes the best way to preserve a moment is to simply be in it.

**What I'm aiming for**: Intentional sharing that doesn't interfere with presence. Share for connection, not for performance. Share to maintain relationships, not to prove I'm traveling. The core principle is presence over broadcasting.

This might mean:
- Writing to specific people rather than broadcasting to everyone
- Sharing *after* I've left a place, not while I'm in it
- Being okay with some experiences remaining unshared, uncaptured, just mine
- Using social media to receive (see what friends are doing) without constantly broadcasting

I'm not trying to solve this paradox completely right now. I'm just trying to understand the intricacies of what I - and many others - wrestle with. The tension between wanting to preserve and share meaningful experiences, while also knowing that the very act of preservation and sharing can diminish the experience itself.

The goal isn't zero sharing. It's mindful sharing. Being conscious of when the camera or the post comes between you and the moment. Collecting experiences to live, not just to tell. Sometimes the best story is the one you don't share immediately, the one you let settle and mature before putting it into words.
