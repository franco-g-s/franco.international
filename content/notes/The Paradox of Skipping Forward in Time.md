## The Desire to Skip Ahead
We often wish to know the future or to time travel forward and see what happened in retrospect. There's a temptation to skip the difficult or uncertain present and jump straight to the outcome—to see how things turned out, to know if our efforts paid off, to be the "future version" of ourselves who has already achieved what we're working toward.

## What Gets Lost
But by skipping forward, we lose out on the in-between—we stay static. In a certain sense, that defeats the point of time even passing. While everything else might have changed around us, we didn't change. We missed out on that change.

The irony is profound: we want to skip ahead precisely because we believe our future self will be better, more accomplished, or more fulfilled. But that future self will only be who they are because they were once the current self and had to pass through time, experiencing all the growth, failures, lessons, and transformations along the way.  

## Why the Journey Matters
This shows the importance of appreciating the moment and not taking anything for granted, even if you aren't necessarily where you want to be just yet and would much rather be further along in the future.

**The fundamental truth:** The future you will only be where they are because they were once current you and had to pass through time. Skipping forward defeats the purpose—you lose out on the change, learnings, and experiences that make the future you different from current you. Those experiences are precisely why the current you wants to be the future you in the first place.

## The Key Insight
The journey through time isn't just about arriving at the destination—it's about the transformation that happens along the way. Without that transformation, reaching the "future" becomes meaningless. You'd be the same person in different circumstances, rather than a fundamentally changed person who earned those circumstances through growth.

## Connections
This connects to [[notes/Living in the Present Moment|Living in the Present Moment]] from Groundhog Day—both films, in different ways, reveal that the present moment is all we truly have and that trying to escape it or skip past it prevents the very growth and meaning we seek.

In Interstellar, Cooper experiences this directly through time dilation—he "skips" decades of his daughter's life, arriving in the future but having missed the journey. The pain of this loss illustrates the cost of jumping through time without experiencing it.
