## Simulation Results
Time for infection to spread globally in different network structures:
- **Fully clustered network:** 73 days
- **10% shortcuts (small-world):** 26 days (almost 3x faster!)
- **Fully random network:** 25 days (barely faster than small-world)

## The Critical Finding
With less than **1% of links being shortcuts**, diseases spread almost as fast as if everyone were randomly connected.

## Why This Matters
**Global pandemics spread quickly because:**
- Most transmission is local (clustered)
- But just a few long-distance connections (shortcuts) dramatically accelerate spread
- You don't need many international travelers to create global pandemic
**This also explains:**
- Why information goes viral rapidly on social media
- How ideas permeate seemingly separated communities quickly
- Why targeting [[notes/Network Hubs and Preferential Attachment|hubs]] is so effective for control

## The Exponential Effect
In the simulation, introducing shortcuts:
- Created exponential growth at the beginning
- Then nearly linear spread (can't go faster than moving to each node)
- Final result: 3x faster than without shortcuts
The ramp-up is what's dangerous—by the time you notice widespread infection, it's already too late to prevent global spread.

## Public Health Implications
**Prevention strategies:**
- Target hubs for maximum impact (Thailand's HIV success)
- Expect rapid spread in interconnected modern world
- Plan assuming small-world properties
- Few restrictions on shortcuts can have large effects
**Why blanket approaches often fail:**
- Treating all connections equally ignores network structure
- Hubs and shortcuts have disproportionate impact
- Network-aware interventions are much more efficient
