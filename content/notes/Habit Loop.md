The habit loop describes the three key parts of a habit that form a cycle. They are:
1. The Cue
	- First stage of the habit loop, in which you are triggered by a stimulus that initiates the habit. The stimulus can be internal (thoughts, feelings, emotions) or external (time of day, location, something you see or do). 
2. The Routine
	- Second stage of the habit loop, in which the actual behavior is executed in response to the cue. It can be a physical action, a mental response, or even an emotional reaction.
3. The Reward
	- Third and final stage of the habit loop, in which you receive a positive outcome or benefit as a result of completing the routine. They can be tangible or intangible, and serve as a form of positive reinforcement for the habit. It reinforces the link between the cue and the routine, making it more likely that you'll repeat the habit in the future.

To alter or [[notes/Breaking Habits|break a habit]], any part of the habit loop can be removed or modified. As a consequence all of the other parts will change as well, seeing as they are interdependent. 
For example, if you execute a certain routine when you get stimulated by a certain cue and receive a certain reward, you can change the routine, making sure you get the same reward and get stimulated by the same cue. This will replace the old habit with a new one, without having to avoid the cue or reward.
