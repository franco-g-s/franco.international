To break habits, you must alter or take [[notes/Habit Loop|Habit Loop]] apart. If you remove either the cue or reward from the loop, it will fall apart. Without a cue, the routine won't be executed and a reward won't be received, breaking the habit. Without a reward, even if you get stimulated by the cue and execute the routine, you won't get a reward, and therefore will be less likely to execute the routine the next time you get stimulated by the same cue. 

“Change might not be fast and it isn’t always easy. But with time and effort, almost any habit can be reshaped.” The [[notes/Habit Framework|Habit Framework]] serves as a practical guide to changing habits.
