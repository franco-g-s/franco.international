## The Prisoner's Dilemma
Two players can cooperate or defect:
- Both cooperate: 3 coins each
- One defects: Defector gets 5, cooperator gets 0
- Both defect: 1 coin each
**Rational outcome:** Both defect (getting 1 instead of 3)
**But with repeated play:** Cooperation wins through reciprocity ("tit-for-tat")

## Revolutionary Finding: Same People, Different Outcome
Take identical people with identical strategies. Change **only** how they're connected:
### Highly Clustered Networks → Cooperation Thrives
- Players interact repeatedly with same small group
- Cooperation spreads and dominates
- Trust develops through familiarity
- Defectors are isolated and surrounded
**Why it works:** "Little clumps" of repeated encounters foster cooperation. You know you'll see these people again, so cooperation is advantageous.
### Networks with Shortcuts → Cooperation Collapses
- Defectors spread their strategy faster
- Cooperators can't establish stable local clusters
- Critical threshold where cooperation drops to zero
- System becomes dominated by betrayal
**Why it fails:** [[notes/Network Shortcuts|Network Shortcuts]] connect you to strangers you'll never see again, removing the incentive to cooperate.

## The Shocking Conclusion
You can go from a world of cooperation to a world of betrayal by **only changing how people are connected**, not who they are or what strategies they use.

## The Knife Edge Effect
Real human experiments revealed:
- Networks are "on a knife edge" of instability
- One person's initial choice can tip the entire network
- If one person starts cooperating → everyone cooperates
- If one person starts defecting → everyone defects
The world could go either way depending on seemingly random initial conditions.

## Adding Choice Changes Everything
When players could **choose who to interact with** (avoiding defectors):
- Cooperation emerged reliably
- The more choice players had, the more cooperation appeared
- Being proactive about relationships enables cooperation
**Key insight:** You can't just hope for cooperation—you have to actively curate who you interact with.

## Practical Implications
**For cooperation to emerge:**
- Need repeated interactions (clustering)
- Need ability to choose partners (avoid defectors)
- Need stable communities (not just random shortcuts)
**Why this matters:**
- Explains keyboard warrior phenomenon (see [[notes/Social Media and Network Toxicity|Social Media and Network Toxicity]])
- Shows structure matters more than individual character
- Proves you can change behavior by changing connections

## The Meta-Lesson
Cooperation isn't just about being a good person. It's about being in the **right network structure** that enables and rewards cooperation. Without that structure, even well-intentioned people will defect.

## Movements and Social Change

This understanding of how structure enables cooperation helps explain how social movements emerge and spread. [[notes/Social Habits of Movements|Movements]] begin through [[notes/Strong Ties|strong ties]] (close friendships), grow through [[notes/Weak Ties|weak ties]] that connect communities, and endure when they create new habits that give participants a sense of identity and ownership.

The three-part structure mirrors the network principles: strong ties provide the initial clustering needed for cooperation to take root, weak ties allow the movement to spread across communities while maintaining enough structure, and new shared habits create the repeated interactions that sustain cooperation.
