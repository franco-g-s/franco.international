To trick [[notes/Familiarity Loop|Familiarity Loop]], you can “dress something new in old clothes”. This makes the unfamiliar seem familiar, and integrates the new thing in an established habit. One way of doing this is by sandwiching the new thing between old ones, for example, a new song is added to a radio station between two established good performing songs. Another example is targeted advertising. When a company knows want to advertise to you a specific product that it knows you will buy, without spooking you, it hides it between irrelevant advertisements, making it seem familiar. 
On an individual level, people tend to be more likely to stick to working out if they do it in groups where they can socialize and meet new people. In this case, a new thing (exercising) is wrapped in something people already know (meeting new people).
