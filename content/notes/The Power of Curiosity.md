Curiosity is universal. Labradors, porpoises, two-year-olds, and every person who presses *enter* on Google is curious. However, it is much more powerful than we realize.

Curiosity also dictates the quality of many ordinary experiences.

“Curiosity isn’t just a tool for improving your own life and happiness, your ability to win a great job or a great spouse. It is the key to the things we say we value most in the modern world: independence, self-determination, self government, self-improvement. Curiosity is the path to freedom itself.”
