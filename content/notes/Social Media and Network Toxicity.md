## The Keyboard Warrior Phenomenon
People say things online they'd never say in person. This isn't about individuals being bad—it's about network structure enabling bad behavior.

## Traditional Communities vs. Social Media
### Traditional Communities (Enable Cooperation)
- **High clustering:** Repeated interactions with same people
- **Few shortcuts:** Limited outside contact
- **Accountability:** Familiarity breeds responsibility
- **Result:** Cooperation emerges naturally (see [[notes/Network Structure and Cooperation|Network Structure and Cooperation]])
### Social Media (Breeds Toxicity)
- **Low clustering:** Mostly interacting with strangers
- **Many shortcuts:** Anyone can reach anyone
- **Few repeated interactions:** You'll likely never encounter this person again
- **Anonymity/distance:** Reduced accountability
- **Result:** Cooperation collapses, toxicity spreads

## Why Structure Matters More Than People
The prisoner's dilemma research shows:
- Same people in clustered networks → cooperate  
- Same people with too many [[notes/Network Shortcuts|Network Shortcuts]] → defect and betray
Most people are **nice in real life** because real life has:
- Repeated encounters  
- Local communities (clustering)
- Face-to-face accountability
Social media removes all these cooperative-enabling structures.

## The Double-Edged Sword
"It's a small world after all" was supposed to be about unity and connection.
**Small worlds enable:**
- Global connectivity
- Rapid information spread
- Weak tie benefits
- Toxic exposure
- Pandemic spread (ideas and diseases)
- Attack vectors for malevolence

## What Went Wrong
The initial promise: "Connect people who have been separated geographically."  
**What we lost:**
- Local clustering that makes cooperation possible
- Repeated interactions that build trust
- Stable communities with shared norms
- "Pockets" where cooperation can flourish
**What we gained:**
- Global reach to strangers
- Exposure to toxicity without protection
- Conduits for malevolence
- Speed without accountability
**Net result:** By many measures, social media has been negative despite increasing connectivity.

## The Structural Problem
You can't fix toxic social media just by:
- Asking people to be nicer  
- Better moderation (though it helps)
- Education about online behavior
The structure itself—low clustering, many random shortcuts, few repeated interactions—is **fundamentally incompatible with cooperation**.

## Possible Solutions
**Design for cooperation:**
- Increase clustering (stable communities)
- Limit random shortcuts (don't show everyone everything)
- Enable repeated interactions (same people over time)
- Give users choice about who they interact with
- Balance reach with community
**Personal strategies:**
- Curate who you follow/interact with
- Build smaller, stable communities
- Avoid engaging with strangers who are toxic
- Recognize the structure is working against cooperation

## The Lesson
We gained global connectivity but lost the local structure that enables cooperation. The challenge is: **Can we design networks that maintain both?**
