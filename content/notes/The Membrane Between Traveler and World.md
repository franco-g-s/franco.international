  - The journey is more important than the destination

There's a gradient of separation between you and the world when you travel, and where you fall on that spectrum fundamentally changes the nature of the experience.

At one extreme, you have the plane - completely sealed, climate-controlled, pressurized. You could be anywhere. The view from the window is so distant it might as well be a screensaver. You're hermetically isolated from the world you're supposedly traveling through.

A car adds some connection back. You can crack the window, feel some wind, smell the air when you stop. But you're still fundamentally separated by glass and metal, filtered air, and the ability to be comfortable at any temperature. The windshield becomes a screen between you and what's outside.

Motorcycles break down more of that barrier. You're exposed to wind and weather, you feel the temperature drop as you climb elevation, you smell the shifts in the landscape. But the engine does the work - you're not fully engaged physically with the act of moving through space.

On a bike, there's almost nothing between you and the world. You can't ignore a headwind - it slows you to a crawl and demands everything you have. You feel the temperature dropping in real-time as evening approaches. You smell rain coming before you see it, notice the exact moment the landscape transitions from farmland to forest, feel the road surface change beneath your tires.

This vulnerability is actually a feature, not a bug. It forces engagement with the environment in a way that sealed, comfortable travel never can. You can't tune out the world when you're exposed to it - when it's pushing back against you, when it's soaking you with rain, when it's burning your skin with sun.

The repetitive motion of cycling creates a meditative state. Your body is occupied with the physical act of moving, which paradoxically frees your mind to wander. It's different from the passive mind-wandering of driving, where you're still mentally engaged with traffic and navigation. On a bike, especially on long, quiet stretches of road, your mind can truly drift while your body works.

Each layer of separation you remove makes you more present in the journey. The membrane between traveler and world thins, and in that thinning, something essential about travel is recovered. You stop being transported *through* a landscape and start being *in* it.
