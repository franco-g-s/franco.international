## The Two-Faced Cycle
Samsara is the Buddhist concept of the cycle of mundane existence—a perpetual state of running from pain and running toward pleasure that paradoxically perpetuates suffering ([[notes/The Paradox of Samsara|The Paradox of Samsara]]). In Groundhog Day, Phil embodies both sides: running from pain through insults, escape mechanisms (drinking, sleeping), and self-loathing, while running toward pleasure with "another drink, more recognition"—always wanting more. Neither brings satisfaction; both keep him trapped.  

## The Emptiness of Consequence-Free Living
When Phil discovers he can do anything without consequences—eat whatever, rob banks, pursue any pleasure—he becomes deeply dissatisfied. Pure desire without meaning is "like being a dumb animal eating grass at the edge of a cliff." When nothing matters, everything loses meaning. Phil reaches pure nihilism where even death offers no escape—he kills himself repeatedly but still wakes up miserable.

This directly illustrates [[notes/Wanting Less Instead of Having More|the satisfaction dilemma: achieving goals brings only temporary satisfaction before the dopamine drops and you need to start again]]. Phil demonstrates that you can't escape the cycle by winning at its game.  

## Liberation Through Letting Go
Phil breaks free only when he stops trying to get what he wants (romance, escape, pleasure) and starts acting from genuine care—doing things because they're right, not because they serve his desires. As Shantideva says, this is the fate of most humans: "a half-conscious, lifelong struggle between running from pain and running towards pleasure." The cycle doesn't end by fulfilling cravings but by letting go of craving itself.
