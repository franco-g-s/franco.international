## The Challenge of Purpose
Purpose is one of the three macronutrients of happiness, but it's "a weird one" - it's actually hard to figure out what it even is.

## What Purpose Provides
Purpose involves finding:
- **Coherence** in your life
- **Goals** that matter to you  
- **Significance** in your existence

## The Two Essential Questions
If you're feeling like life doesn't have enough purpose or meaning, you need to answer these fundamental questions:
## The Consequence of Not Having Answers
If you don't have an answer to **one or both** of these questions, you're going to have an **existential crisis**.

This isn't a threat - it's a natural human response to lack of meaning and direction.

## The Search Process
You need to "go in search with your life" of answers to these two questions. This means:
- Active exploration, not passive waiting
- Living experimentally to discover what matters
- Paying attention to what energizes vs. drains you
- Reflecting on moments of deep fulfillment
- Considering what you'd regret not doing

## The Personal Nature of Purpose
**Brooks won't tell you what your answers should be** - and that's the point. Purpose is deeply individual:
- Different for different people
- Can't be prescribed by others
- Must be discovered through personal experience
- Authentic to your unique values and calling

## Purpose and Happiness Connection
**Does purpose lead to happiness?** "Oh, yeah."

Purpose isn't just nice to have - it's essential for sustained happiness. Without it, you can have enjoyment and satisfaction but still feel empty or directionless.

## Your Assignment
1. Seriously contemplate: "Why am I alive?"
2. Honestly ask yourself: "For what would I be willing to die?"
3. If you can't answer, begin actively searching through:
   - New experiences
   - Service to others
   - Creative expression
   - Deep reflection
   - Meaningful relationships

## The Process vs. the Destination
Finding purpose is often more about the search itself than arriving at final answers. The questions keep you oriented toward meaning-making and significance, which is what purpose really provides.

The goal isn't to find the "perfect" purpose, but to live with intentional attention to what makes life meaningful and worth living.
