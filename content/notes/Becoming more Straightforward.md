“What makes simple people gratifying to be around isn’t that their intentions are always unproblematic for us; it’s that we know exactly what those intentions are from the start.” This means that second-guessing, inferring, decoding, untangling, unscramble or translating aren’t necessary. 
To become more straightforward, you have to stop doubting the legitimacy of your desires. You have to share your true feelings and desires in a polite and inoffensive way.
