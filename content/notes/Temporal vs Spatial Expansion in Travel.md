  - The journey is more important than the destination

There's something counterintuitive about slow travel: it actually gives you *more* time, not less.


When you fly somewhere, those 8 hours disappear into a void. You board, maybe sleep fitfully, watch a movie you won't remember, eat food you can't taste, and arrive disoriented. The time was *consumed* by travel without actually *being* travel. It's dead time, a gap between departure and arrival.

But when you bikepack for 8 hours, every one of those hours is full:
- The early morning cold that gradually warms as you ride
- The conversation with someone at a rest stop who points you toward a better route
- The problem-solving when you realize you've taken a wrong turn
- The decision about whether to push on or start looking for camp
- The gradual revelation of a mountain range as you approach it over hours instead of minutes

The journey becomes *content*, not just a gap. This is what the [[media/youtube/We've Forgotten how to Travel|video]] means when it talks about accumulating distance slowly - you're not just covering ground, you're filling time with experience.

Modern travel collapses both time and space. Bikepacking expands both. What "should" take 2 hours by car becomes a full day's journey, but that expansion creates space for observation, contemplation, the kind of mental wandering that doesn't happen in transit lounges.

This temporal expansion is essential for transformation. You can't be transformed by something you're unconscious for, by time that disappears. The expansion of time in slow travel creates space for that transformation to happen - for thoughts to develop, for the journey to sink in, for your relationship with the landscape to evolve.

It's also about memory formation. Those 8 hours on the bike will be vivid in your memory months or years later - you'll remember the quality of light, the exact difficulty of that headwind, the taste of that sandwich at the midday stop. The 8 hours in the plane? They'll blur into every other flight, indistinguishable and forgettable.

Slow travel doesn't steal your time. It gives it back to you, filled with substance.
