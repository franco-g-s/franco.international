## The Paradox
Two seemingly contradictory truths exist simultaneously in social networks:
1. **People cluster locally** - Most friends live nearby and know each other (high clustering coefficient)
2. **Global connectivity is short** - You can reach anyone on the planet in ~6 steps

## Why This Is Surprising
If everyone only knew their 100 nearest neighbors in a circle arrangement of 8 billion people:
- Reaching someone on the other side would take **80 million steps**
- Average connection between any two people: **40 million steps**
- Getting even 10% of the way there: **8 million steps**
Yet in reality, the average is closer to **6 steps**.

## The Real-World Phenomenon
The "small-world problem" gets its name from the common experience of meeting a stranger on holiday who somehow knows your best friend, prompting you to say: "Wow, it's such a small world!"
This isn't coincidence—it's a fundamental property of how human networks are structured.

## The Resolution
The paradox is resolved by [[notes/Network Shortcuts|Network Shortcuts]]—a small number of connections that reach outside local clusters, dramatically collapsing distances while maintaining high local clustering.
