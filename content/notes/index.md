# Academic Notes

This section contains my notes from courses at ETH Zurich and other academic pursuits. These are post-processed, atomic notes organized by topic rather than raw class notes.

## Topics

Notes are organized by subject area. Browse using the file explorer or search for specific topics.

[As you publish notes, they'll appear here organized by course/topic folders]
