Organizations are “made up of fiefdoms where members compete for power or credit, hidden in skirmishes that make their performances appear superior and their rivals’ seem worse.” . But most of the time they still move along because of routines (habits) that create truces. 
These organizational habits promise that continued profits if the patters and truces are followed, but sometimes an unstable peace can be destructive. This occurs when the truces are one-sided, but a clear leadership still has to be present. Habits have to be implemented that balance authority and choose a person (or goal) that rises above everybody else.
