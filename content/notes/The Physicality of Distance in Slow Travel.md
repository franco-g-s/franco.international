In our modern world, distance has become abstract - just a number on a screen, a duration in a plane seat. But when you're bikepacking, 100km isn't a statistic, it's an experience that lives in your body and mind.

Distance becomes visceral. It's in your legs as they push through the kilometers, in your lungs as you climb that endless pass, in the hours you spend watching the sun move across the sky. This creates what [[media/youtube/We've Forgotten how to Travel|Like Stories of Old]] might call "proper" travel - where the journey itself transforms you because you're *in* it, not just transported *through* it.

When you fly somewhere, those 8 hours disappear into a void. You board in one reality and step off into another, with nothing to show for the gap but jet lag and a vague sense of displacement. The distance between departure and arrival has been collapsed into a momentary disorientation.

But on a bike, every one of those kilometers is real. Your perception of what's "far" completely recalibrates. A 50km ride that would have seemed trivial in a car becomes a significant undertaking. The mental checkpoints you create - "just to that next village," "just to the top of this climb" - mark real progress through space that you've earned with your body.

This physical reckoning with distance changes how you remember places. The hard-earned kilometers create stronger memories than the easy ones. When you finally arrive somewhere after days of cycling through valleys and over passes, you know the terrain intimately because you crossed it inch by inch. You understand the landscape in a way that's impossible from behind a windshield or from 30,000 feet.

The accumulation of distance is gradual, building with every pedal stroke. You feel yourself moving further from home not just geographically, but psychologically. Each day on the road adds weight to the journey. By the time you're deep into a bikepacking trip, you can feel the distance you've traveled - it's written in your tired muscles, your sun-weathered face, your evolving relationship with the landscape.

This is what modern travel has lost in its pursuit of efficiency. We've optimized away the very thing that makes travel meaningful: the physical experience of crossing distance. We've traded transformation for convenience, and in doing so, we've forgotten what it means to truly travel.
