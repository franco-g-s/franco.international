Willpower is one of the most important [[notes/Keystone Habits|Keystone Habits]] for individual success. It has a bigger influence on academic performance than intelligence. 
Willpower by itself isn't a skill, it’s more like a muscle. It can be used up, restored and conserved. 
Additionally, the willpower muscle can be strengthened, and when it is, it acts as a keystone habit, spilling good habits into other areas unrelated to where willpower is being exercised. 
To make willpower a habit, **inflection points** have to be identified and routines have to be planned. Inflections points are times when your willpower runs out. When the inflection points occur, the predetermined routine is followed. Then a reward is received and a [[notes/Habit Loop|habit loop]] is established.
