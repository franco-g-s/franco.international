The familiarity loop is a variation of [[notes/Habit Loop|Habit Loop]]. 
Our brains crave familiarity. It simplifies a lot of decision-making and helps the brain choose what to focus on. For example, even if you claim to not like a certain artist, if one of their songs plays on the radio, it sounds familiar, you probably won’t change the station. You react to the cue (this song sounds like the others), you listen to the song and are rewarded by being able to sing along.
