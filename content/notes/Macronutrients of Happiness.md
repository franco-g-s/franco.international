## The Framework
Just like your Thanksgiving dinner needs protein, carbohydrates, and fat, your happiness needs three essential components in both **balance** and **abundance**:
1. **Enjoyment**
2. **Satisfaction** 
3. **Purpose**
These are the "macronutrients of happiness" - you need all three for complete psychological nutrition.

### What It Is
Enjoyment is **not** just pleasure. It's **pleasure with consciousness**.
### Key Characteristics:
- Uses your prefrontal cortex
- Involves awareness and mindfulness
- Goes beyond basic sensory pleasure
- Requires conscious participation
### Examples:
- Savoring food mindfully vs. mindless eating
- Appreciating music vs. having it as background noise
- Conscious social connection vs. superficial interaction

### What It Is
The joy you get from **a job well done**. It's your reward for:
- **Striving**
- **Working** 
- **Even suffering**
### Key Characteristics:
- Earned through effort
- Connected to achievement and progress
- Often involves overcoming challenges
- Builds sense of competence and mastery
### Examples:
- Completing a difficult project
- Learning a new skill
- Overcoming obstacles
- Personal growth through challenges

### What It Is
Finding **coherence**, **goals**, and **significance** in your life.
### Key Characteristics:
- Provides meaning and direction
- Connects you to something larger than yourself
- Gives context to daily actions
- Creates sense of significance
### Examples:
- Contributing to causes you believe in
- Serving others
- Creating something meaningful
- Living according to your values

## The Balance Requirement
You need **all three** for true happiness. Having just one or two creates imbalance:
- **Only enjoyment**: Superficial, temporary highs
- **Only satisfaction**: Grim workaholism without joy
- **Only purpose**: Martyrdom without personal fulfillment

## The Abundance Requirement
It's not enough to have minimal amounts - you need these in **abundance**. This means:
- Actively cultivating all three
- Not settling for "just enough"
- Recognizing when one area needs more attention
- Building practices that nourish each macronutrient

## Application
Regularly assess your life across these three dimensions:
- Am I experiencing genuine enjoyment (not just pleasure)?
- Am I finding satisfaction through meaningful work and effort?
- Do I have a clear sense of purpose and significance?
If any area is lacking, that's where to focus your energy for greater overall happiness.
