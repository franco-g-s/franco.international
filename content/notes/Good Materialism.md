Materialism isn't inherently bad. As with many things in life, it's the dose that makes the poison. "Bad materialism isn't really an excessive fondness of objects and possessions; rather, it stems from a failure to appreciate objects properly. Truly 'good' materialism leads us to want fewer things and to choose them with care." Having fewer things means that we are free to pay more attention to and appreciate each of those things.
