## Overview
Any two people on Earth can be connected through approximately six steps or fewer, despite living in a world of 8 billion people. This phenomenon reveals fundamental principles about how networks function and shape our world.

## Core Concepts
- [[notes/The Small-World Paradox|The Small-World Paradox]] - How we maintain local clustering while achieving global connectivity
- [[notes/Network Shortcuts|Network Shortcuts]] - Why just 3 in 10,000 connections being shortcuts creates six degrees of separation
- [[notes/The Strength of Weak Ties|The Strength of Weak Ties]] - How acquaintances matter more than close friends for opportunities
- [[notes/Network Hubs and Preferential Attachment|Network Hubs and Preferential Attachment]] - Why popular nodes become more popular and what it means
- [[notes/Disease Spread in Small-World Networks|Disease Spread in Small-World Networks]] - How network structure accelerates or slows contagion
- [[notes/Network Structure and Cooperation|Network Structure and Cooperation]] - How the prisoner's dilemma reveals that connection patterns determine behavior
- [[notes/Social Media and Network Toxicity|Social Media and Network Toxicity]] - Why online platforms breed negativity despite connecting people

## Key Applications Summary
**Personal life:**
- Attend events outside your usual circle (create shortcuts)
- Maintain weak ties (they bridge to opportunities)
- Choose your relationships proactively (cooperation needs the right structure)
- Be the first mover (individual action cascades)
**Public health:**
- Target hubs for epidemic control (Thailand's HIV success)
- Expect rapid spread in small-world networks (plan accordingly)
- Few shortcuts dramatically accelerate transmission
**Medicine:**
- Target hub molecules in disease networks
- Understand system vulnerabilities through network structure
**Social change:**
- Reach hubs/influencers for amplification
- Small initial actions can cascade widely
- Timing and positioning matter due to preferential attachment
**Technology/design:**
- Balance clustering (community) with shortcuts (reach)
- Too many random connections kill cooperation
- Structure determines emergent behavior

## Research Papers & Key Researchers
- **Duncan Watts & Steve Strogatz** (1998) - "Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks" in *Nature* (58,000+ citations) - Solved small-world problem with shortcuts model
- **Albert-László Barabási & Reka Albert** (1999) - Discovered scale-free networks and preferential attachment mechanism
- **Mark Granovetter** (1973) - "The Strength of Weak Ties" - Showed acquaintances more valuable than close friends for certain outcomes
- **Robert Axelrod** (1980) - *The Evolution of Cooperation* - Proved cooperation wins through iteration in prisoner's dilemma
- **Stanley Milgram** (1967) - Original "small world experiment" - Found average chain length of ~6 steps
