## Overview
*[Notes in progress - watched 2026-01-30]*

Arrival explores how language shapes perception, particularly our experience of time. Where Interstellar examines the desire to skip through time, Arrival presents a different question: what does it mean to experience time non-linearly—to know the future but still choose to live through each moment?

## Core Concepts
- [[notes/The Bootstrap Paradox - Determinism and Free Will in Time Loops|The Bootstrap Paradox - Determinism and Free Will in Time Loops]] - How Louise's future knowledge enables her present choices, creating a causality loop with no beginning

## Initial Observations
Both Arrival and [[notes/Interstellar - Key Takeaways|Interstellar]] explore similar themes around time and presence, but from different angles:
- Interstellar: The cost of skipping forward through time
- Arrival: Living with full knowledge of the future while remaining present

## Themes to Explore Further
- The relationship between Language and Perception of time
- How knowing the future changes (or doesn't change) our choices in the present
- The connection to Interstellar's message about appreciating the journey
- The concept of Presence when you simultaneously experience past, present, and future
- Why Louise chooses to live her life even knowing the pain it will bring
