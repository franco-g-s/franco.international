For curiosity to be effective, it has to be harnessed to at least two other key traits. The ability to pay attention to the answers to your questions is one of them. You have to actually absorb whatever it is you’re being curious about. The other is the willingness to act. Curiosity can inspire, it can replenish moral, but at some point you need determination.
