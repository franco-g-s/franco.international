## The Paradox

Running from pain and running toward pleasure—the natural human response to life—paradoxically perpetuates suffering. The cycle doesn't end by fulfilling cravings but by letting go of craving itself.

## The Buddhist Concept

Samsara is the cycle of mundane existence—a perpetual state of running from pain and chasing pleasure that keeps you trapped. As Shantideva says, this is the fate of most humans: "a half-conscious, lifelong struggle between running from pain and running towards pleasure."  

## The Demonstration in Groundhog Day

Phil embodies both sides of samsara:
- **Running from pain**: Through insults, escape mechanisms (drinking, sleeping), self-loathing  
- **Running toward pleasure**: "Another drink, more recognition"—always wanting more

Neither brings satisfaction; both keep him trapped.

## The Emptiness of Fulfillment

When Phil discovers he can do anything without consequences—eat whatever, rob banks, pursue any pleasure—he becomes deeply dissatisfied. Pure desire without meaning is "like being a dumb animal eating grass at the edge of a cliff."

This illustrates the satisfaction dilemma: achieving goals brings only temporary satisfaction before the dopamine drops and you need to start again. You can't escape the cycle by winning at its game. When nothing matters, everything loses meaning. Phil reaches pure nihilism where even death offers no escape.  

## Liberation

Phil breaks free only when he stops trying to get what he wants (romance, escape, pleasure) and starts acting from genuine care—doing things because they're right, not because they serve his desires.

The paradox: the natural human strategy for dealing with life (avoid pain, seek pleasure) is precisely what keeps us suffering. Freedom comes not from better strategies within the cycle, but from stepping outside it entirely by letting go of craving.
